**Project Title**: PINERP (Procurement Intelligence Network Enterprise Resource PLanning)

PINERP is an explainable, intelligence-first ERP designed for growing manufacturers that cannot afford enterprise consultants but still need enterprise-level visibility.
Traditional ERPs tell businesses what happened. PINERP tells them what is happening, why it is happening, and what they should do next.

**Problem Statement**

To build a Mini ERP System that digitally manages the complete business flow:
● Product Management
● Sales Management
● Purchase Management
● Manufacturing
● Bill of Materials (BoM)
● Inventory & Stock Tracking
● Procurement Automation

**Features**

Module 1 — Product Master
Product Code / Name, Dimensions / Specifications, Lead Time,
Cost Price / Sales Price, Vendor Product Mapping, Movement Rate, Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)
Procurement Strategy (MTS or MTO), Procurement Type (Purchase or Manufacturing), BoM Link.

Module 2 — Sales + Procurement Intelligence Network (PIN)
Customer management, Sales Order creation, Stock availability check 
Delivery tracking, Automatic reservation, Procurement triggering.
PIN (Market Signals) — before confirming an order, the Sales screen shows any active signals (shortage / price change / delay / availability) reported against the products in the cart, sourced from any authenticated user acting as a field reporter (carpenter, contractor, dealer, supplier, warehouse partner, transporter, employee, procurement partner). This is a real internal mechanism, not a literal external crowdsourcing network — see Section 5 for the exact table.

Module 3 — Inventory & Stock Ledger
On Hand Quantity, Reserved Quantity, Free-to-Use Quantity — `On Hand − Reserved`; this is the number every availability check uses.
Real-time stock visibility, Low-stock alerts, Auto-suggested reorder quantities, Stock reconciliation,
Shortage detectionm, Stock Ledger

Module 4 — Procurement Automation & Intelligence
Procurement Engine, Automatic PO/MO creation, MTS Engine (predicts demand, manufactures/purchases in advance)
MTO Engine, Forecasting Engine ("AI-Enhanced Procurement")
Batch Purchase Optimization, Vendor Performance Intelligence
Profit-Driven Procurement Prioritization (Pareto Engine)

Module 5- Manufacturing

Bill of Materials (BoM), Work Orders
Manufacturing Capacity Visualization — charts work center utilization, throughput, capacity bottlenecks, and delayed queues for proactive production planning.

"Why Is It Late?" Causal Delay Tracer
Causal Delay Tracer — one click on any delayed order traces the dependency chain backward (e.g. SO delayed → MO blocked → screw shortage → PO pending → vendor delayed) and returns a plain-English explanation such as: "SO-145 is delayed because Manufacturing Order MO-87 could not proceed due to insufficient screws. Purchase Order PO-22 remains unfulfilled by Vendor X."
Procurement Link Graph — an auto-generated relationship table storing SO→MO, SO→PO, and MO→PO links, used to construct the dependency chain.
Recursive Trace Engine — uses a recursive SQL query (graph traversal) to walk the link graph backward to the root cause. No machine learning required.
Explanation Generator — converts the structured trace into plain English via deterministic templates, with optional LLM polishing for nicer phrasing.

Cross-Cutting Platform Features
Real-Time Visibility — WebSockets push order status changes, stock updates, delays, procurement events, and audit events to every connected dashboard instantly, with no manual refresh.
Role-Based Access Control — JWT + middleware; users only access the modules permitted by their role (see Roles table above).
Audit Log Module — tracks status changes, quantity updates, price changes, deliveries, procurement events, manufacturing completion, and user actions, for end-to-end traceability.

AI Operations Assistant — not a separate system; it packages outputs from the other deterministic engines into:
Data Integrity Monitoring — detects negative stock, missing stock records, suspicious inventory patterns.
Automated Daily Reports — summaries for inventory, sales, purchases, delays, and forecasting.
Predictions — demand trends, procurement requirements, MTO material needs (reuses the Forecasting Engine).
Strategic Recommendations — fast-moving products, profit drivers, procurement priorities (reuses the Pareto Engine + Vendor Performance Intelligence).
Real-Time Dashboard — home screen aggregating Sales (totals/pending/delayed), Inventory (low-stock/critical shortages), Manufacturing (bottlenecks/utilization), Procurement (pending POs/vendor performance), and Strategy (top profit contributors/forecast insights), all live via WebSocket.
Tier A Customer Portal — isolated external login (separate from internal RBAC) for customers to track orders, view delivery estimates, monitor reserved stock, leave reviews, and view communication history.
